" Fullinwider also discusses challenges which could arise in multicultural education when teachers from the majority culture begin to delve into these deeper issues",['also']
" For example, when majority teachers interact with minority students, the distinction between "high culture" and "home culture" needs to be clear or else faculty and staff members could mistakenly withdraw their rightful authority to evaluate and discipline students' conduct and quality of work (Fullinwider, 2005)",['for example']
" To clarify, without a clear understanding of true culture, educators could easily misattribute detrimental conduct or sub-par behavior to a minority student's cultural background (Fullinwider, 2005) or misinterpret signs that a student may require out-of-school intervention",['that']

"Machiavelli put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people, who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is too late",['that']
" He hypothesized that a hybrid system of government incorporating facets of all three major types (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) could break this cycle",['that']
" However, in modern democracies there is usually no direct correlation with Machiavelli's idea, because of weakening of the separation of powers, or erosion of the original function of the various branches",['because']
" For example, the modern United States executive branch has slowly accumulated more power from the legislative branch, and the Senate no longer functions as a quasi-aristocratic body as was originally intended, since senators are now democratically elected",['since', 'for example']
"Some have tried to argue that the Coase theorem applies to political markets as well",['that', 'as well']

Most home computers, such as this Tandy Color Computer 3, featured a version of the BASIC programming language",['as']
" They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user",['as']
" These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability",['as']
" Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming",['also', 'but']
" There were, however, commercial kits like the Sinclair ZX80 which were both home and home-built computers since the purchaser could assemble the unit from a kit",['since']
"
Advertisements in the popular press for early home computers were rife with possibilities for their practical use in the home, from cataloging recipes to personal finance to home automation, but these were seldom realized in practice",['but']
" For example, using a typical 1980s home computer as a home automation appliance would require the computer to be kept powered on at all times and dedicated to this task",['as', 'for example']
"
By contrast, advertisements in the specialty computer press often simply listed specifications",['by contrast', 'simply']
" If no packaged software was available for a particular application, the home computer user could program one—provided they had invested the requisite hours to learn computer programming, as well as the idiosyncrasies of their system",['if', 'as well']
" Since most systems shipped with the BASIC programming language included on the system ROM, it was easy for users to get started creating their own simple applications",['since']
" Another change from the home computer era is that the once-common endeavour of writing one's own software programs has almost vanished from home computer use",['that']

As early as 1965, some experimental projects such as Jim Sutherland's ECHO IV explored the possible utility of a computer in the home",['as']
" In 1969, the Honeywell Kitchen Computer was marketed as a luxury gift item, and would have inaugurated the era of home computing, but none were sold",['but']
" Early microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 had front-mounted switches and diagnostic lights (nicknamed "blinkenlights") to control and indicate internal system status, and were often sold in kit form to hobbyists",['as']

To save the cost of a dedicated monitor, the home computer would often connect through an RF modulator to the family TV set, which served as both video display and sound system",['as']
" In direct mode, the BASIC interpreter was also used as the user interface, and given tasks such as loading, saving, managing, and running files",['also']
" One exception was the Jupiter Ace, which had a Forth interpreter instead of BASIC",['instead']

Still, home computers competed in the same market as the consoles",['still', 'as']
" A home computer was often seen as simply as a higher end purchase than a console, adding abilities and productivity potential to what would still be mainly a gaming device",['still', 'simply']
" A common marketing tactic was to show a computer system and console playing games side by side, then emphasizing the computer's greater ability by showing it running user-created programs, education software, word processing, spreadsheet and other applications while the game console showed a blank screen or continued playing the same repetitive game",['while']
" Though it could be costly, it permitted the computer user to access services like Compuserve and private or corporate bulletin board systems to post or read messages, or to download or upload software",['though']
" This never materialised, but a standalone computer, the Coleco Adam was eventually released",['but', 'eventually']
" While most of the programs in these books were short and simple games or demos, some titles such as Compute!'s SpeedScript series, contained productivity software that rivaled commercial packages",['while', 'as']
" These books also served a role in familiarizing new computer owners with the concepts of programming; some titles added suggested modifications to the program listings for the user to carry out",['also']

During the peak years of the home computer market, scores of models were produced, usually as individual design projects with little or no thought given to compatibility between different manufacturers or even within product lines of the same manufacturer",['as']
"
Introduced in August 1981, the IBM Personal Computer would eventually supplant CP/M as the standard platform used in business",['as', 'eventually']
" This was largely due to the IBM name and the system's 16 bit open architecture, which expanded maximum memory tenfold, and also encouraged production of third-party clones",['also']
" Apple Computer's 1980 Apple III was underwhelming, and although the 1984 release of the Apple Macintosh introduced the modern GUI to the market, it wasn't common until IBM-compatible computers adopted it",['although']
" By the late 1980s, many mass merchants sold video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System, but no longer sold home computers",['but']
" Toward the end of the 1980s, clones also became popular with non-corporate customers",['also']
" In Europe, the home computer remained a distinct presence for a few years more, with the low-end models of the 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST families being the dominant players, but by the mid-1990s even the European market had dwindled",['but']
" Naturally, these businesses chose to equip their employees with the same systems they themselves were using",['naturally']
" Many systems also had a dot matrix printer for producing paper output",['also']
" Most had a keyboard integrated into the same case as the motherboard, or, more frequently, a mainboard—while the expandable home computers appeared from the very start (the Apple II offered as much as seven expansion slots), as the whole segment was generally aimed downmarket, few offers were priced and/or positioned high enough to allow for such expandability",['more + [a-z]*ly', 'while']
"
Sometimes they were equipped with a cheap membrane or chiclet keyboard in the early days, although full-travel keyboards quickly became universal due to overwhelming consumer preference",['although']
" Indeed, the use of a television set as a display almost defines the pre-PC home computer",['as']
" The reason for this was that while those TV-monitors had difficulty displaying the clear and readable 80-column text that became the industry standard at the time, the only consumers who really needed that were the power users utilizing the machine for business purposes, while the average casual consumer would use the system for games only and was content with the lower resolution for which a TV worked fine",['while']
" A first time computer buyer who brought a base C-64 system home and hooked it up to their TV would find they needed to buy a disk drive (the Commodore 1541 was the only fully compatible model) or Datasette before they could make use of it as anything but a game machine or TV Typewriter",['but']
" The TI was originally to use the 8-bit 9985 processor designed especially for it, but this project was cancelled",['but']
" Another exception was the Soviet Elektronika BK series of 1984, which used the fully 16-bit and powerful for the time 1801 series CPU, offering a full PDP-11 compatibility and a fully functional Q-Bus slot, though at the cost of very anemic RAM and graphics",['though']
"
Processor clock rates were typically 1–2 MHz for 6502 and 6809 based CPU's and 2–4 MHz for Z80 based systems (yielding roughly equal performance), but this aspect was not emphasized by users or manufacturers, as the systems' limited RAM capacity, graphics abilities and storage options had a more perceivable effect on performance than CPU speed",['but']
" To economize on component cost, often the same crystal used to produce color television compatible signals was also divided down and used for the processor clock",['also']

" The later 16-bit machines such as the Atari 1040ST (not the 520ST), the Commodore Amigas, and the Tandy 1000s did house floppy drive(s) internally",['as']
" At any rate, to expand any computer with additional floppy drives external units would have to be plugged in",['at any rate']

Various copy protection schemes were developed for floppy disks; most were broken in short order",['in short']
" Many users would only tolerate copy protection for games, as wear and tear on disks was a significant issue in an entirely floppy-based system",['as']

In another defining characteristic of the home computer, instead of a command line, the BASIC interpreter served double duty as a user interface",['instead']
" This made startup times very fast – no more than a few seconds – but made OS upgrades difficult or impossible without buying a new unit",['but']

Mainstream commercial PC and console games are generally developed in phases: first, in pre-production, pitches, prototypes, and game design documents are written; if the idea is approved and the developer receives funding, then full-scale development begins",['first', 'if']
" However, it is important to estimate a game's financial requirements, such as development costs of individual features",['as']
" In fact, the majority of commercial games do not produce profit",['in fact']

The game industry requires innovations, as publishers cannot profit from constant release of repetitive sequels and imitations",['as']
" Similarly, many developers close down because they cannot find a publishing contract or their production is not profitable",['because']
" Nevertheless, growth of casual and mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams to enter the market",['nevertheless']
" A developer receiving profit from a successful title may store up capital to expand and re-factor their company, as well as tolerate more failed deadlines",['as', 'as well']
" A game designer generally writes an initial game proposal document, that describes the basic concept, gameplay, feature list, setting and story, target audience, requirements and schedule, and finally staff and budget estimates",['finally']
" Publisher's company may also own the developer's company, or it may have internal development studio(s)",['also']

All but the smallest developer companies work on several titles at once",['but']
" This is necessary because of the time taken between shipping a game and receiving royalty payments, which may be between 6 and 18 months",['because']

The history of game making begins with the development of the first video games, although which video game is the first depends on the definition of video game",['although']
" The first games created had little entertainment value, and their development focus was separate from user experience—in fact, these games required mainframe computers to play them",['in fact']
" Some games were different, however, such as Gun Fight, which was significant for several reasons: an early 1975 on-foot, multi-directional shooter, which depicted game characters, game violence, and human-to-human combat",['as']
"
The flood of Pong clones led to the video game crash of 1977, which eventually came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito's 1978 arcade shooter game Space Invaders, marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market",['eventually']
" Its creator Nishikado not only designed and programmed the game, but also did the artwork, engineered the arcade hardware, and put together a microcomputer from scratch",['also', 'but', 'not only']
" At the same time, home computers appeared on the market, allowing individual programmers and hobbyists to develop games",['at the same time']
" A very large number of games could be produced by an individual, as games were easy to make because graphical and memory limitation did not allow for much content",['because', 'as']
" The developers of many early home video games, such as Zork, Baseball, Air Warrior, and Adventure, later transitioned their work as products of the early video game industry",['as']
" I wouldn't recommend it for someone with a weak heart or a large appetite, though",['though']

Chris Crawford and Don Daglow in 1987 similarly advised prospective designers to write games as a hobby first, and to not quit their existing jobs early",['first', 'as']

In the early 2000s, also mobile games started to gain popularity",['also']
" For example, in 2007 Blizzard Entertainment's parent company, Vivendi Games merged with Activision",['for example']
" The producer working for the developer is known as the internal producer and manages the development team, schedules, reports progress, hires and assigns staff, and so on",['as']

"
A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by an external video game developer",['either', '(E|e)(ither).+?(or)']
" As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising",['as']

" Large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish",['while', 'also', 'instead']
"
Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design",['as']
"
Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality",['also', 'as']
"
Because the publisher usually finances development, it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary",['because']
" The most represented are artists, followed by programmers, then designers, and finally, audio specialists, with two to three producers in management",['finally']
" Other positions, such as testers, may be employed only part-time",['as']
" In larger projects, there are often separate designers for various parts of the game, such as, game mechanics, user interface, characters, dialogue, etc",['as']

A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related software (such as game development tools)",['as']
" As opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community, level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for consistency and clear layout before required artwork is completed",['as']
" Composers who create a game's musical score also comprise a game's sound team, though often this work is outsourced",['also', 'though']
"
The testers ensure that the game falls within the proposed design: it both works and is entertaining",['that']
" Although, necessary throughout the whole development process, testing is expensive and is often actively utilized only towards the completion of the project",['although']
"
Game development is a software development process, as a video game is software with art, audio, and gameplay",['as']
" Games with poor development methodology are likely to run over budget and time estimates, as well as contain a large number of bugs",['as', 'as well']
"
Overall game development is not suited for typical software life cycle methods, such as the waterfall model",['as']
" For example, asset creation may be done via waterfall model, because requirements and specification are clear,  but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping",['because', 'but', 'for example']
"[citation needed]
If the developer acts as its own publisher, or both companies are subsidiaries of a single company, then only the upper management needs to give approval",['if', 'as']
"[citation needed] Producers may work part-time on the game at this point, scaling up for full-time commitment as development progresses",['as']
" A great deal of prototyping may take place during pre-production before the design document is complete and may, in fact, help determine what features the design specifies",['in fact']
" Prototyping at this stage is often done manually, (paper prototyping), not digitally[citation needed], as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources into what could be a canceled idea or project",['as']
"
Prototypes are often meant only to act as a proof of concept or to test ideas, by adding, modifying or removing some of the features",['as']
" Therefore, usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these testbed tools",['therefore']
" In case the prototype is in a physical form, programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper, dice, and other easy to access tools in order to make the prototype faster",['in order to']

Mainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed",['as']

Game design is an essential and collaborative process of designing the content and rules of a game, requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills",['as', 'as well']
" Even if an off-the-shelf game engine is used, a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game",['if']
" As level designers and artists use the tools for level building, they request features and changes to the in-house tools that allow for quicker and higher quality development",['as']
" Because of the dynamic environment of game development, the design of early levels may also change over time",['also', 'because']

Sound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects",['either', '(E|e)(ither).+?(or)']
" As development draws to a close, a single game usually employs many testers full-time (and often with overtime)",['as']
" Testing is vital for modern, complex games as single changes may lead to catastrophic consequences",['as']
" As new features are added, subtle changes to the codebase can produce unexpected changes in different portions of the game",['as']
" Also, features that are added late in development are prioritized and existing features often receive insufficient testing time",['also']
" Such milestones may be, for example, first playable, alpha, or beta game versions",['for example']
" It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met",['but']
" Some common milestones for two-year development cycle are as follows:
The first playable is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets, this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements",['as']
" A game in alpha is feature complete, that is, game is playable and contains all the major features",['that is']
" Additional small, new features may be added, similarly planned, but unimplemented features may be dropped",['but']
" Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase, rather than implementing additions",['rather than']
" Alpha occurs eight to ten months before code release, but this can vary significantly based on the scope of content and assets any given game has",['but']

Gold master is the final game's build that is used as a master for production of the game",['that is']
" Although many companies are reducing the amount of crunch time, it is still prominent in smaller companies",['still', 'although']
"
After the game goes gold and ships, some developers will give team members comp time (perhaps up to a week or two) to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game, though this compensation is not standard",['though']
" This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware; making incompatibility, the cause of many bugs, a non-issue",['since']
" In this case, maintenance would only occur in the case of a port, sequel, or enhanced remake that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets",['in this case']
"
Programmers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible",['as']
" The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it's intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked past code release, or in rare cases, fix unintended problems caused by previous patches",['but']
"
Several development disciplines, such as audio, dialogue, or motion capture, occur for relatively short periods of time",['as']
" The team advises the developer on target demographics and market trends, as well as suggests specific features",['as', 'as well']
" The demo is usually intended for journalists, buyers, trade shows, general public, or internal employees (who, for example, may need to familiarize with the game to promote it)",['for example']

As a game nears completion, the publisher will want to showcase a demo of the title at trade shows",['as']
"[citation needed]
The major annual trade shows are, for example, Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) or Penny Arcade Expo (PAX)",['for example']
"
A game created in one language may also be published in other countries which speak a different language",['also']
" For example, some games created for PlayStation Vita were initially published in Japanese language, like Soul Sacrifice",['for example']
" Different levels of translation range from: zero translation being that there is no translation to the product and all things are sent raw, basic translation where only a few text and subtitles are translated or even added, and a full translation where new voice overs and game material changes are added",['that']

Moreover, in order to fit into the local markets, game production companies often change or redesign the graphic designs or the packaging of the game for marketing purposes",['in order to', 'moreover']

Universities offer Computer Science degrees which give you a strong basis of knowledge if you wish to become a programmer 
Video game industry employment is fairly volatile, similar to other artistic industries including television, music, etc",['if']
" This may be one reason why game developers tend to congregate geographically; if their current studio goes under, developers can flock to an adjacent one or start another from the ground up",['if']
" Numerous games may start development and are cancelled, or perhaps even completed but never published",['but']
"
In the early days of video games (from the early 1970s to mid-1980s), a game programmer also took on the job of a designer and artist",['also']
" This was generally because the abilities of early computers were so limited that having specialized personnel for each function was unnecessary",['that', 'because']
" Game concepts were generally light and games were only meant to be played for a few minutes at a time, but more importantly, art content and variations in gameplay were constrained by computers' limited power",['more + [a-z]*ly', 'but']
"
Later, as specialized arcade hardware and home systems became more powerful, game developers could develop deeper storylines and could include such features as high-resolution and full color graphics, physics, advanced artificial intelligence and digital sound",['as']
" Technology has advanced to such a great degree that contemporary games usually boast 3D graphics and full motion video using assets developed by professional graphic artists",['that']
" Now, only some games, such as the puzzle game Bejeweled, are simple enough to require just one full-time programmer",['as']
"
A contemporary video game may include advanced physics, artificial intelligence, 3D graphics, digitised sound, an original musical score, complex strategy and may use several input devices (such as mice, keyboards, gamepads and joysticks) and may be playable against other people via the Internet or over a LAN",['against', 'as']
" Some programmers may specialize in one area of game programming, but many are familiar with several aspects",['but']
" The number of programmers needed for each feature depends somewhat on programmers' skills, but mostly are dictated by the type of game being developed",['but']
" Increasingly, video games use existing game engines, either commercial, open source or free",['either', '(E|e)(ither).+?(or)']
" For example, a space game may need simulated gravity, but would not have any need for simulating water viscosity",['but', 'for example']
"
For a role-playing game such as World of Warcraft, only one physics programmer may be needed",['as']
" For a complex combat game such as Battlefield 1942, teams of several physics programmers may be required",['as']
" Some 2D graphics skills have just recently become useful again, though, for developing games for the new generation of cell phones and handheld game consoles",['though']

Some games, such as strategy games like Civilization III or role-playing video games such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, use AI heavily, while others, such as puzzle games, use it sparingly or not at all",['while', 'as']
" Many studios also make their games' scripting available to players, and it is often used extensively by third party mod developers",['also']
" Although both areas do borrow from each other, they are usually considered distinct disciplines, though there are exceptions",['although']
" For example, the 2001 game by Lionhead Studios Black & White features a unique AI approach to a user controlled creature who uses learning to model behaviors during game-play",['for example']
" Computer audio games eschew graphics altogether and use sound as their primary feedback mechanism",['as']
"
Many games use advanced techniques such as 3D positional sound, making audio programming a non-trivial matter",['as']
" These tools allow designers to associate sounds with characters, actions, objects and events while also assigning music or atmospheric sounds for game environments (levels or areas) and setting environmental variables such as reverberation",['while', 'also']
" This is usually not a separate discipline, as what this programmer does usually differs from game to game, and they will inevitably be involved with more specialized areas of the game's development such as graphics or sound",['as']
" Many of these aspects may be altered by programmers who specialize in these areas, however (for example, strategy tables may be implemented by AI programmers)",['for example']
"
In early video games, gameplay programmers would write code to create all the content in the game—if the player was supposed to shoot a particular enemy, and a red key was supposed to appear along with some text on the screen, then this functionality was all written as part of the core program in C or assembly language by a gameplay programmer",['if']
" The game engine deals with graphics rendering, sound, physics and so on while a scripting language deals with things like cinematic events, enemy behavior and game objectives",['while']
"
Scripters usually are also game designers",['also']
" Though some games have custom user interfaces, this programmer is more likely to develop a library that can be used across multiple projects",['though']
" Most UIs look 2D, though contemporary UIs usually use the same 3D technology as the rest of the game so some knowledge of 3D math and systems is helpful for this role",['as', 'though']
" Advanced UI systems may allow scripting and special effects, such as transparency, animation or particle effects for the controls",['as']
" Now game programmers must account for a wide range of input devices, but the joystick today is supported in relatively few games, though still dominant for flight simulators",['still', 'but', 'though']
"
Input programming, while usually not a job title, or even a full-time position on a particular game project, is still an important task",['while', 'still']
" This programmer writes the code specifying how input devices such as a keyboard, mouse or joystick affect the game",['as']
" A real-time motion-controlled game utilizing devices such as the Wii Remote or Kinect may need a very complex and low latency input system, while the HID requirements of a mouse-driven turn-based strategy game such as Heroes of Might and Magic are significantly simpler to implement",['while', 'as']
" Programmers implementing these game features can spend all their time in this one role, which is often considered one of the most technically challenging",['most + [a-z]*ly']
" Although multi-player features can consume the entire production timeline and require the other engine systems to be designed with networking in mind, network systems are often put off until the last few months of development, adding additional difficulties to this role",['although']
" Game development Tools are often contain features such as script compilation, importing or converting art assets, and level editing",['as']
" While some tools used may be COTS products such as an IDE or a graphics editor, tools programmers create tools with specific functions tailored to a specific game which are not available in commercial products",['while', 'as']
" For example, an adventure game developer might need an editor for branching story dialogs, and a sport game developer could use a proprietary editor to manage players and team stats",['for example']
" Sometimes, the programmer is responsible for making the application work not for just one operating system, but on a variety of devices, such as mobile phones",['as', 'but']
"
This programmer must be familiar with both the original and target operating systems and languages (for example, converting a game originally written in C++ to Java), convert assets, such as artwork and sounds or rewrite code for low memory phones",['for example']
" This programmer may also have to side-step buggy language implementations, some with little documentation, refactor code, oversee multiple branches of code, rewrite code to scale for wide variety of screen sizes and implement special operator guidelines",['also']
" They may also have to fix bugs that were not discovered in the original release of a game",['also']
" Unlike other members of the programming team, the technology programmer usually isn't tied to a specific project or type of development for an extended length of time, and they will typically report directly to a CTO or department head rather than a game producer",['rather than']
" As the job title implies, this position is extremely demanding from a technical perspective and requires intimate knowledge of the target platform hardware",['as']
"
In smaller teams, one or more programmers will often be described as 'Generalists' who will take on the various other roles as needed",['as']
" However, the lead programmer is still expected to program at least some of the time and is also expected to be knowledgeable in most technical areas of the game",['still', 'also']
" There is often considerable common ground in the role of technical director and lead programmer, such that the jobs are often covered by one person",['that', 'such that']
"
Game programmers can specialize on one platform or another, such as the Wii U or Windows",['as']
" So, in addition to specializing in one game programming discipline, a programmer may also specialize in development on a certain platform",['also']
" Therefore, one game programmer's title might be "PlayStation 3 3D Graphics Programmer",['therefore']
" Also, general game development principles such as 3D graphics programming concepts, sound engineering and user interface design are naturally transferable between platforms",['naturally', 'also', 'as']
"
Notably, there are many game programmers with no formal education in the subject, having started out as hobbyists and doing a great deal of programming on their own, for fun, and eventually succeeding because of their aptitude and homegrown experience",['because', 'as', 'eventually', 'notably']

Results of a 2010 survey in the United States indicate that the average salary for a game programmer is USD$95,300 annually",['that']

Though sales of video games rival other forms of entertainment such as movies, the video game industry is extremely volatile",['as', 'though']
" Game programmers are not insulated from this instability as their employers experience financial difficulty",['as']
" If a milestone or deadline is not met (or for a host of other reasons, like the game is cancelled), funds may become short and the developer may be forced to retrench employees or declare bankruptcy and go out of business",['if']
" Game programmers who work for large publishers are somewhat insulated from these circumstances, but even the large game publishers can go out of business (as when Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames and several projects were cancelled; or when The 3DO Company went bankrupt in 2003 and ceased all operations)",['as', 'but']
" This is why some prefer to consult and are therefore somewhat shielded from the effects of the fates of individual studios",['therefore']
" As such, highly optimized code is required for these games to run at an acceptable frame rate",['as']
" Because of this, compiled code is typically used for performance-critical components, such as visual rendering and physics calculations",['because', 'as']
" Almost all PC games also use either the DirectX, OpenGL APIs or some wrapper library to interface with hardware devices",['also', 'either', '(E|e)(ither).+?(or)']

Various script languages, like Ruby, Lua and Python, are also used for the generation of content such as gameplay and especially AI",['also', 'as']

Java is used for many web browser based games because it is cross-platform, does not usually require installation by the user, and poses fewer security risks, compared to a downloaded executable program",['because']
" Java is also a popular language for mobile phone based games",['also']
"
As games have grown in size and complexity, middleware is becoming increasingly popular within the industry",['as']
" Middleware provides greater and higher level functionality and larger feature sets than the standard lower level APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL, such as skeletal animation",['as']
" In addition to providing more complex technologies, some middleware also makes reasonable attempts to be platform independent, making common conversions from, for example, Microsoft Windows to PS4 much easier",['also', 'for example']
" Essentially, middleware is aimed at cutting out as much of the redundancy in the development cycle as possible (for example, writing new animation systems for each game a studio produces), allowing programmers to focus on new content",['as', 'essentially', 'for example']

Other tools are also essential to game developers: 2D and 3D packages (for example Blender, GIMP, Photoshop, Maya or 3D Studio Max) enable programmers to view and modify assets generated by artists or other production personnel",['also', 'for example']
" IDEs with debuggers (such as Visual Studio) make writing code and tracking down bugs a less painful experience",['as']

" Professor John Zucchi of McGill University states:
Unlike earlier periods when significant ethnic segregation might imply a lack of integration and therefore be viewed as a social problem, nowadays ethnic concentration in residential areas is a sign of vitality and indicates that multiculturalism as a social policy has been successful, that ethnic groups are retaining their identities if they so wish, and old-world cultures are being preserved at the same time that ethnic groups are being integrated",['that', 'as', 'at the same time', 'therefore']

A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool",['as']

Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures",['as']
" In his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define what games are",['that', 'as']

French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men), defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics:
Computer game designer Chris Crawford, founder of The Journal of Computer Game Design, has attempted to define the term game using a series of dichotomies:
Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as[original research?]: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other",['against', 'as']

Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment",['as']
" For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars",['for example']

Dice games use a number of dice as their central element",['as']
" Board games often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the game, however dice games are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success or failure of some other element of the game; they instead are the central indicator of the person's standing in the game",['that', 'instead']
" As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce apparently random numbers, these games usually involve a high degree of luck, which can be directed to some extent by the player through more strategic elements of play and through tenets of probability theory",['as']

Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile",['but']

Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not utilise any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment",['as']
" For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars",['for example']

" There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules",['that', 'even then', 'but']

" But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich, because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign",['if', 'that', 'because', 'but', 'so that']

At the time video games had emerged as a popular form of entertainment in the late 1970s, music was stored on physical medium in analog waveforms such as compact cassettes and phonograph records",['as']
" Such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use making them less than ideal for use in an arcade cabinet, though in rare cases, they were used (Journey)",['though']
"
While this allowed for inclusion of music in early arcade video games, it was usually monophonic, looped or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game, such as the Namco titles Pac-Man (1980) composed by Toshio Kai or Pole Position (1982) composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi",['while']
" It had four descending chromatic bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player",['though']
" The decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code by a programmer, whether or not the programmer had musical experience",['that']
"
As advances were made in silicon technology and costs fell, a definitively new generation of arcade machines and home consoles allowed for great changes in accompanying music",['as']
" This was further improved upon by Namco's 1982 arcade game Dig Dug, where the music stopped when the player stopped moving",['further']
" Dig Dug was composed by Yuriko Keino, who also composed the music for other Namco games such as Xevious (1982) and Phozon (1983)",['also']
"
Home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the ColecoVision in 1982 capable of four channels",['also']
" The home computer Commodore 64 released in 1982 was capable of early forms of filtering effects, different types of waveforms and eventually the undocumented ability to play 4-bit samples on a pseudo fourth sound channel",['eventually']
" Its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers, as well as its ability to use a TV for an affordable display monitor",['as', 'as well']
" For example, if a laser beam was fired by a spaceship, and the laser used a 1400 Hz square wave, then the square wave channel that was in use by music would stop playing music and start playing the sound effect",['if', 'for example']
" That same year, the first known video game to feature speech synthesis was also released: Sunsoft's shoot 'em up game Stratovox",['also']
" Around the same time, the introduction of frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first commercially released by Yamaha for their digital synthesizers and FM sound chips, allowed the tones to be manipulated to have different sound characteristics, where before the tone generated by the chip was limited to the design of the chip itself",['first']
" This differed from Rally-X in that its hardware DAC was used to play back simple waveform samples, and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an FM simulation could not offer",['that']
"
The Amiga offered these features before most other competing home computer platforms though the Macintosh which had been introduced a year earlier had similar capabilities",['though']
" Though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds, each sample required much more data in memory",['though']
" This was at a time when all memory, solid state (ROM cartridge), magnetic (floppy disk) or otherwise was still very costly per kilobyte",['still', 'otherwise']
"
As home consoles moved into the fourth generation, or 16-bit era, the hybrid approach (sampled and tone) to music composing continued to be used",['as']
" The Sega Genesis offered advanced graphics over the NES and improved sound synthesis features (also using a Yamaha chip, the YM2612), but largely held the same approach to sound design",['also', 'but']
" Ten channels in total for tone generation with one for PCM samples were available in stereo instead of the NES's five channels in mono, one for PCM",['instead']
" As before, it was often used for percussion samples",['as']
" Despite the additional tone channels, writing music still posed a challenge to traditional composers and it forced much more imaginative use of the FM synthesizer to create an enjoyable listening experience",['still']
"
As cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes, the evolution of video game music on the Amiga, and some years later game music development in general, shifted to sampling in some form",['as']
" This was further popularized in the early 1990s by games like Street Fighter II (1991) on the CPS-1, which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion",['further']
"
The evolution also carried into home console video games, such as the release of the Super Famicom in 1990, and its US/EU version Super NES in 1991",['also', 'as']
" This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games, such as musical acoustics (early games like Super Castlevania IV, F-Zero, Final Fantasy IV, Gradius III, and later games like Chrono Trigger), directional (Star Fox) and spatial acoustics (Dolby Pro Logic was used in some games, like King Arthur's World and Jurassic Park), as well as environmental and architectural acoustics (Zelda III, Secret of Evermore)",['as', 'as well']
" Many games also made heavy use of the high quality sample playback capabilities (Super Star Wars, Tales of Phantasia)",['also']
" The Neo-Geo home system was capable of the same powerful sample processing as its arcade counterpart, but was several times the cost of a Super NES",['but']
" The Sega CD (the Mega CD outside North America) hardware upgrade to the Mega Drive (Genesis in the US) offered multiple PCM channels, but they were often passed over instead to use its capabilities with the CD-ROM itself",['but', 'instead']
" Partly because of the difference in frame rates of PAL broadcast equipment, many titles released were never redesigned to play appropriately and ran much slower than had been intended, or were never released",['because']
" This divergence would be lessened as the fifth generation of home consoles launched globally, and as Commodore began to take a back seat to general purpose PCs and Macs for developing and gaming",['as']
"
Though the Mega CD/Sega CD, and to a greater extent the PC Engine in Japan, would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in streaming music, the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today",['though']
" Many Square titles continued to use sequenced music, such as Final Fantasy VII, Legend of Mana, and Final Fantasy Tactics",['as']
" In 1996, the Nintendo 64, still using a solid state cartridge, actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of 100 channels of PCM, and an improved sample rate of 48 kHz",['still', 'actually']
" Games for the N64, because of the cost of the solid state memory, typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two however, and music tended to be simpler in construct",['because']
" While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker using pulse width modulation, doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power, rendering its use in games rare",['while']
"
With the increase of x86 PCs in the market, there was a vacuum in sound performance in home computing that expansion cards attempted to fill",['that']
" This made it the first choice for game developers to produce upon, but its higher cost as an end-user solution made it prohibitive",['as', 'but']
"
The AdLib card was usurped in 1989 by Creative's Sound Blaster, which used the same Yamaha FM chip in the AdLib, for compatibility, but also added 8-bit 22",['also', 'but']
" As an affordable end-user product, the Sound Blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early 1990s; a combination of a simple FM engine that supported MIDI, and a DAC engine of one or more streams",['as']
" As general purpose PCs using x86 became more ubiquitous than the other PC platforms, developers drew their focus towards that platform",['as']
" The comparative quality of the samples spurred similar offerings from Soundblaster, but costs for both products were still high",['still', 'but']
"
Unlike the standards of Amiga or Atari, a PC using x86 even then could be using a broad mix of hardware",['even then']
" Developers increasingly used MIDI sequences: instead of writing soundtrack data for each type of soundcard, they generally wrote a fully featured data set for the Roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long as it had a MIDI controller to run the sequence",['instead']
" Some tied into the Yamaha FM chip to simulate instruments, some daughterboards of samples had very different sound qualities; meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate to every other General MIDI device",['that']
" Music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments, allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game",['simply']
"
In fourth generation home video games and PCs this was limited to playing a Mixed Mode CD audio track from a CD while the game was in play (such as Sonic CD)",['while']
" The Ys soundtracks, particularly Ys I & II (1989), are still regarded as some of the most influential video game music ever composed",['still', 'as']
" Optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed, so playing an audio track from the game CD meant that the system could not access data again until it stopped the track from playing",['still', 'that']
" Looping, the most common form of game music, was also problem as when the laser reached the end of a track, it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback",['also']
" This would cut back on memory used for music on the CD, allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music, and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to buffer the data",['also']
" As computing power increased, this load became minimal, and in some cases dedicated chips in a computer (such as a sound card) would actually handle all the decompressing",['actually', 'as']
"
Fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback",['also']
" Using a compressed stream allowed game designers to play back streamed music and still be able to access other data on the disc without interruption of the music, at the cost of CPU power used to render the audio stream",['still']
"
Some games, such as the Wipeout series, continued to use full Mixed Mode CD audio for their soundtracks",['as']
"
An alternate approach, as with the TMNT arcade, was to take pre-existing music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game",['as']
" It is common for X-games sports-based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases (SSX, Tony Hawk, Initial D), as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in to music (Need For Speed: Underground, Gran Turismo, and Grand Theft Auto)",['as well']
" Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used, such as in Dance Dance Revolution",['as']
"
As processing power increased dramatically in the 6th generation of home consoles, it became possible to apply special effects in realtime to streamed audio",['as']
" In SSX, a recent video game series, if a snowboarder takes to the air after jumping from a ramp, the music softens or muffles a bit, and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing becomes louder to emphasize being airborne",['if']
" Stealth-based games will sometimes rely on such music, either by handling streams differently, or dynamically changing the composition of a sequenced soundtrack",['either', '(E|e)(ither).+?(or)']
" Some PC games, such as Quake, play music from the CD while retrieving game data exclusively from the hard disk, thereby allowing the game CD to be swapped for any music CD",['while', 'as']

Some PlayStation games supported this by swapping the game CD with a music CD, although when the game needed data, players had to swap the CDs again",['although']

Many games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other early game consoles feature a similar style of musical composition that is sometimes described as the "video game genre",['that is', 'as']
" The genre's compositional elements largely developed due to technological restraints, while also being influenced by electronic music bands, particularly Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), who were popular during the late 1970s to 1980s",['while', 'also']
"
Although the tones featured in NES music can be thought of emulating a traditional four-piece rock band (triangle wave used as a bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and a white noise channel used for drums), composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes, in part due to the restrictions mentioned above",['although', 'as']
" This is similar to music composition during the Baroque period, when composers, particularly when creating solo pieces, focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the harpsichord that do not allow for expressive dynamics",['as']

" These would overlap with later influences from heavy metal and j-pop music, resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the 16-bit era",['equally']

" Despite the strict guidelines, some exceptions have occurred: Bionic Commando (though swastikas were eliminated in the US version), Smash TV and Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode contained human violence, the latter also containing implied sexuality and tobacco use; River City Ransom and Taboo: The Sixth Sense contained nudity, and the latter also contained religious images, as did Castlevania II and III",['also', 'though']
"
A known side effect of this policy was the Genesis version of Mortal Kombat selling over double the number of the Super NES version, mainly because Nintendo had forced publisher Acclaim to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game, making it less violent",['because']
" By contrast, Sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code was required to unlock the gore)",['by contrast', 'though']
" The only clear-set rule is that ESRB AO-rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America, a practice which is also enforced by Sony and Microsoft, its two greatest competitors in the present market",['that', 'also']
" For example, Konami was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 Game Boy Color game Metal Gear Solid (although the previous NES version of Metal Gear and the subsequent GameCube game Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes both included such references, as did Wii game MadWorld), and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo 64 port of Cruis'n USA",['although', 'for example']

Nintendo of America also had guidelines before 1993 that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, in addition to the above content guidelines",['also']
"
The last rule was circumvented in a number of ways; for example, Konami, wanting to produce more games for Nintendo's consoles, formed Ultra Games and later Palcom to produce more games as a technically different publisher",['for example']
" This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies, as they could not afford to start additional companies",['as']
" In another side effect, Square Co (now Square Enix) executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the Nintendo 64 along with the degree of censorship and control that Nintendo enforced over its games, most notably Final Fantasy VI, were factors in switching its focus towards Sony's PlayStation console",['most + [a-z]*ly', 'that', 'notably']

Nintendo is opposed to any third-party emulation of its video games and consoles, stating that it is the single largest threat to the intellectual property rights of video game developers",['that']

Though it was less technically advanced than the Lynx and other competitors, the Game Boy's excellent battery life and rugged hardware and the popularity of the bundled Tetris and other games made it much more successful",['though']
" At a March 14, 1994 press conference in San Francisco, Nintendo vice president of marketing Peter Main answered queries about when Nintendo was coming out with a color handheld system by stating that sales of the Game Boy were strong enough that it had decided to hold off on developing a successor handheld for the near future",['that']

"In the history of computer and video games, the fourth generation (more commonly referred to as the 16-bit era) of game consoles began on October 30, 1987 with the Japanese release of NEC Home Electronics' PC Engine (known as the TurboGrafx-16 in North America)",['more + [a-z]*ly', 'as']
" Although NEC released the first console of this era, sales were mostly dominated by the rivalry between Nintendo's and Sega's consoles in North America: the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES; the Super Famicom in Japan) and the Sega Genesis (named the Mega Drive in other regions)",['although']
" Handheld systems released during this time include the Nintendo Game Boy, released in 1989, and the Sega Game Gear, first released in 1990",['first']

Nintendo was able to capitalize on its success in the previous, third generation, and managed to win the largest worldwide market share in the fourth generation as well",['as well']
" Several other companies released consoles in this generation, but none of them were widely successful",['but']
" Nevertheless, there were other companies that started to take notice of the maturing video game industry and begin making plans to release consoles of their own in the future",['nevertheless']
" Finally, this generation ended with the discontinuation of the Neo Geo in 2004",['finally']

In the United States, NEC used Bonk, a head-banging caveman, as their mascot and featured him in most of the TurboGrafx advertising from 1990 to 1994",['as']
" The platform was well received initially, especially in larger markets, but failed to make inroads into the smaller metropolitan areas where NEC did not have as many store representatives or as focused in-store promotion",['but']
" The TurboGrafx-16 and its CD combination system, the Turbo Duo, ceased manufacturing in North America by 1994, though a small amount of software continued to trickle out for the platform",['though']
" This also led to Congressional hearings to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children, and to the creation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and the Entertainment Software Rating Board",['also']
" Sega concluded that the superior sales of their version of Mortal Kombat were outweighed by the resulting loss in consumer trust, and cancelled the game's release in Spain to avoid further controversy",['that', 'further']
" The Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service reported that during the key shopping month of November 1994, 63% of all 16-bit video game consoles sold were Sega systems",['that']
"
The console was never popular in Japan (being regularly outsold by the PC Engine), but still managed to sell 40 million units worldwide",['still', 'but']
" While this made perfect sense for the Japanese market, it was disastrous in North America: the market for Genesis games was much larger than for the Saturn, but Sega was left without the inventory or software to meet demand",['while', 'but']

Nintendo executives were initially reluctant to design a new system, but as the market transitioned to the newer hardware, Nintendo saw the erosion of the commanding market share it had built up with the Nintendo Entertainment System",['as', 'but']

" The Phillips CD-i's main selling point was that it was more than a game machine and could be used for multimedia needs",['that']
" Due to an agreement between Nintendo in Philips about an abortive CD add-on for the SNES, Philips also had rights to use some of Nintendo franchises",['also']

Nintendo, NEC and Sega also competed with hardware peripherals for their consoles in this generation",['also']
"99 at release, the CD add-on was not a popular purchase, but was largely responsible for the platform's success in Japan",['but']

Nintendo also made two attempts with the Satellaview and the Super Game Boy",['also']
" Nintendo, working along with Sony, also had plans to create a CD-ROM drive for the SNES (plans that resulted in a prototype version of the Sony PlayStation), but eventually decided not to go through with that project, opting to team up with Philips in the development of the add-on instead (contrary to popular belief, the CD-i was largely unrelated to the project)",['also', 'but', 'eventually', 'instead']
"
The fourth generation was also the era when the act of buying imported US games became more established in Europe, and regular stores began to carry them",['also']
" This means that a game designed for the NTSC standard without any modification would run 17% slower and have black bars at the top and bottom when played on a PAL television",['that']
"[further explanation needed] Developers often had a hard time converting games designed for the American and Japanese NTSC standard to the European and Australian PAL standard",['further']
" Companies such as Konami, with large budgets and a healthy following in Europe and Australia, readily optimized several games (such as the International Superstar Soccer series) for this audience, while most smaller developers did not",['while', 'as']
"
Also, few RPGs were released in Europe because the market for the genre was not as large as in Japan or North America, and the increasing amount of time and money required for translation as RPGs became more text-heavy, in addition to the usual need to convert the games to the PAL standard, often made localizing the games to Europe a high-cost venture with little potential payoff",['also', 'because']

" In 2013, Spike opted to rename the awards from VGA to VGX as to reflect that they wanted to focus more on next-generation games that were being ushered in by the onset of the eighth generation of consoles, as well as bringing comedian Joel McHale to co-host alongside Keighley",['that', 'as', 'as well']
" The 2013 show was considered to be disappointing and aimed as a more commercial work rather than a celebration of video game achievements",['rather than']

" Instead, Keighley worked with several entities within the industry, including console hardware manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, and several large publishers, to financially back and craft a new awards show, the Game Awards, with Spike's blessing",['instead']
" Keighley has been approached by broadcast networks offering to air the show, but he had refused these offers, allowing them to keep the freedom of how they present and structure the show",['but']
"
Keighley considered it important that the Game Awards presentation is aimed to favorably present the interest of gamers and of the industry, and to be welcoming to celebrities and others that have shown interest in video games",['that']
" While the Game Awards are principally an awards show, Keighley knew the importance of having additional content, having seen other experiments of video game awards shows that were only dedicated to awards fail due to lack of audience",['while']
" Keighley believed that the Game Awards should fall somewhere between the entertainment venues that are used for the Academy Awards, and the standard award presentation used for the Game Developers Choice Awards, and wanted a balance of material",['that']
" Keighly encourages developers and publishers to provide any content that might be deemed exciting or that can pique interest, even if these games are at an early stage of development, and then makes the selection of which games and trailers to feature",['if']

Although personal computers only became popular with the development of the microprocessor and microcomputer, computer gaming on mainframes and minicomputers had previously already existed",['although']
" By the 1980s, personal computers had become powerful enough to run games like Adventure, but by this time, graphics were beginning to become an important factor in games",['but']
" Later games combined textual commands with basic graphics, as seen in the SSI Gold Box games such as Pool of Radiance, or The Bard's Tale, for example",['for example']

As with second-generation video game consoles at the time, early home computer game companies capitalized on successful arcade games at the time with ports or clones of popular arcade games",['as']

Further improvements to game artwork and audio were made possible with the introduction of FM synthesis sound",['further']

" It has been estimated that children in the United States are spending 25 percent of their waking hours watching television and playing video games",['that']

The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research or just for fun",['as']
" in the 1960s, professors and students played games such as 3D tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing",['as']
" These games were played on computer such as the IBM 1560, and moves were made by means of punch cards",['as']
" Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls and popular, affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to play games on their home TVs",['as']
" This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems",['rather than']
"
The first electronic digital computers, Colossus and ENIAC, were built during World War II to aid the Allied war effort against the Axis powers",['against']
" This in turn promoted the adoption of computers by universities, government organizations, and large corporations as the decade progressed",['as']
" It was in this environment that the first video games were born",['that']
"
The computer games of the 1950s can generally be divided into three categories: training and instructional programs, research programs in fields such as artificial intelligence, and demonstration programs intended to impress or entertain the public",['as']
" Because these games were largely developed on unique hardware in a time when porting between systems was difficult and were often dismantled or discarded after serving their limited purposes, they did not generally influence further developments in the industry",['because', 'further']
"
The earliest known chess computer program was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne called Turochamp, which was completed in 1950 but not actually implemented by them on a computer",['actually', 'but']
"
The earliest known[by whom?][citation needed] electronic computer games actually implemented were two custom built machines called Bertie the Brain and Nimrod, which played tic-tac-toe and the game of Nim, respectively",['actually']
" Bertie the Brain, designed and built by Josef Kates at Rogers Majestic, was displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition in 1950, while Nimrod, conceived by John Bennett at Ferranti and built by Raymond Stuart-Williams, was displayed at the Festival of Britain and the Berlin Industrial Show in 1951",['while']
" Before these, automated games like the simple chess simulator El Ajedrecista (1914) and Nimrod's predecessor Nimatron (1940) had been created as electro-mechanical devices",['as']
"
Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than to demonstrate the power of some technology, train personnel, or aid in research was Tennis for Two, designed by William Higinbotham and built by Robert Dvorak at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1958",['rather than']
" Furthermore, they were costly and relatively scarce commodities, so computer time was a precious resource that could not be wasted on frivolous pursuits like entertainment",['furthermore']
" As the computer operated in real time and thus allowed for interactive programming, MIT allowed students to program the computer to conduct their own research, perhaps the first time that university students were allowed to directly access a computer for their own work",['that', 'as']
" Further, the university decided to allow students to set the computer to tasks outside the bounds of classwork or faculty research during periods of time no one was signed up to do official work",['further']
" MIT provided a similar level of access to the computer for students as it did for the TX-0, resulting in the creation of the first (relatively) widespread, and thus influential, computer game, Spacewar!
Spacewar! is credited as the first widely available and influential computer game",['as']
"
As computing resources continued to expand over the remainder of the decade through the adoption of time sharing and the development of simpler high-level programming languages like BASIC, an increasing number of college students began programming and sharing simple sports, puzzle, card, logic, and board games as the decade progressed",['as']
" These creations remained trapped in computer labs for the remainder of the decade, however, because even though some adherents of Spacewar! had begun to sense the commercial possibilities of computer games, they could only run on hardware costing hundreds of thousands of dollars",['even though', 'because', 'though']
" As computers and their components continued to fall in price, however, the dream of a commercial video game finally became attainable at the start of the 1970s",['as', 'finally']
" While still far too costly for the home, these advances lowered the cost of computing enough that it could be seriously considered for the coin-operated games industry, which at the time was experiencing its own technological renaissance as large electro-mechanical target shooting and driving games like Sega Enterprises's Periscope (1967) and Chicago Coin's Speedway (1969) pioneered the adoption of elaborate visual displays and electronic sound effects in the amusement arcade",['while', 'still', 'that']
" Consequently, when a recent engineering graduate from Utah with experience running coin-operated equipment named Nolan Bushnell first saw Spacewar! at SAIL in late 1969 or early 1970, he resolved to build a coin-operated version for public consumption",['first', 'consequently']
"
Meanwhile, Ralph Baer, an engineer with a degree in television engineering working for defense contractor Sanders Associates, had been working on a video game system that could be plugged into a standard television set since 1966",['meanwhile']
" Due to the limited abilities of the system, which could only render three spots and a line, most of the graphic and gameplay elements were actually defined by plastic overlays attached to the TV set along with accessories like boards, cards, and dice",['actually']
"
In 1972, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney decided to strike out on their own and incorporated their preexisting partnership as Atari",['as']
" Alcorn's version ended up being so fun that Atari decided to release it as Pong",['that']
" The success of Pong did not result in the displacement of traditional arcade amusements like pinball, but did lay the foundation for a successful video arcade game industry",['but']
" Gun Fight was also one of the first arcade games to incorporate a microprocessor, starting a shift away from video arcade games engineered using dedicated TTL hardware to video games programmed in software",['also']
" By banning eating, drinking, and smoking, and maintaining a full staff at all times to keep an eye on the facilities, Millman created a safe environment where parents could feel safe leaving their older children while browsing other stores in the mall",['while']
"
The emergence of solid state pinball in the late 1970s, in which electro-mechanical technologies like relays were replaced by the newly emerging microprocessor, temporarily stole the limelight from video games, which once again entered a period of decline in 1977 and 1978",['once again']
" While individual games like Atari's Breakout (1976) and Cinematronics' Space Wars (1978) sold in large numbers during this period, overall profitability began to lag",['while']
" The market surged once again, however, after the introduction of the Taito game Space Invaders by Midway in 1979",['once again']
" Atari, meanwhile, entered the consumer market that same year with the single-chip Home Pong system designed by Harold Lee",['meanwhile']
" Toy company Coleco Industries used this chip to create the million-selling Telstar console model series (1976–77), while dozens of other companies released models as well",['while', 'as well']
" As older model dedicated consoles were heavily discounted and consumers with more purchasing power transitioned to the new programmable systems, newer dedicated systems with more advanced features like Video Pinball from Atari and the Odyssey 4000 were squeezed out by their lower priced predecessors and their more sophisticated programmable replacements",['as']
"
In the 1960s, a number of computer games were created for mainframe and minicomputer systems, but these failed to achieve wide distribution due to the continuing scarcity of computer resources, a lack of sufficiently trained programmers interested in crafting entertainment products, and the difficulty in transferring programs between computers in different geographic areas",['but']
" Furthermore, the widespread adoption of the PDP-10, released by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1966, and the portable UNIX operating system, developed at Bell Labs in 1971 and released generally in 1973, created common programming environments across the country that reduced the difficulty of sharing programs between institutions",['furthermore']
" Finally, the founding of the first magazines dedicated to computing like Creative Computing (1974), the publication of the earliest program compilation books like 101 BASIC Computer Games (1973), and the spread of wide-area networks such as the ARPANET allowed programs to be shared more easily across great distances",['more + [a-z]*ly', 'finally']
" As a result, many of the mainframe games created by college students in the 1970s influenced subsequent developments in the video game industry in ways that, Spacewar! aside, the games of the 1960s did not",['as a result', 'as']
" On the mainframe, however, such games were generally not possible due both to the lack of adequate displays (many computer terminals continued to rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into the 1970s and even most CRT terminals could only render character-based graphics) and insufficient processing power and memory to update game elements in real time",['rather than']
" While 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade and console hardware of the period, the need to parcel out computing resources to dozens of simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities",['while']
" Perhaps the most significant game of the period was Colossal Cave Adventure (or simply Adventure), created in 1976 by Will Crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from the newly released tabletop role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)",['simply']
"
While most games were created on hardware of limited graphic ability, one computer able to host more impressive games was the PLATO system developed at the University of Illinois",['while']
" Intended as an educational computer, the system connected hundreds of users all over the United States via remote terminals that featured high-quality plasma displays and allowed users to interact with each other in real time",['as']
" This allowed the system to host an impressive array of graphical and/or multiplayer games, including some of the earliest known computer RPGs, which were primarily derived, like Adventure, from D&D, but unlike that game placed a greater emphasis on combat and character progression than puzzle solving",['but']
" Starting with top-down dungeon crawls like The Dungeon (1975) and The Game of Dungeons (1975), more commonly referred to today by their filenames, pedit5 and dnd, PLATO RPGs soon transitioned to a first-person perspective with games like Moria (1975), Oubliette (1977), and Avatar (1979), which often allowed multiple players to join forces to battle monsters and complete quests together",['more + [a-z]*ly']

" Taito designer Tomohiro Nishikado decided to build on the popularity of Breakout by replacing the paddle in the game with a gun battery and the bricks in the game with rows of aliens that would descend line-by-line while firing at the player",['while']
"
Games such as Galaxian, Galaga and Donkey Kong were popular in arcades during the early 1980s",['as']
"
Space Invaders introduced or popularized several important concepts in arcade video games, including play regulated by lives instead of a timer or set score, gaining extra lives through accumulating points, and the tracking of the high score achieved on the machine",['instead']
" It was also the first game to confront the player with waves of targets that would shoot back at the player and the first to include background music during game play, a simple four-note loop",['also']
" With its intense game play and competitive scoring features, Space Invaders became a national phenomenon as over 200,000 invader games—counting clones and knockoffs—entered Japanese game centers by the middle of 1979",['as']
" While not quite as popular in the United States, Space Invaders became the biggest hit the industry had seen since the Great Depression as Midway, serving as the North American manufacturer, moved over 60,000 cabinets",['as']
" The one-two punch of Space Invaders and the Atari game Asteroids (1979), which moved 70,000 units and popularized the recording of multiple high scores in a table, resulted in video arcade games completely displacing pinball and other amusements to become the central attraction of not just the shopping mall arcade, but also a variety of street locations from convenience stores to bowling alleys to pizza parlors",['also', 'but']
" Many of the best-selling games of 1980 and 1981 such as Galaxian (1979), Defender (1980), Missile Command (1980), Tempest (1981), and Galaga (1981) focused on shooting mechanics and achieving high scores",['as']
" Starting with Pac Man in 1980, which sold 96,000 units in the United States, a new wave of games appeared that focused on identifiable characters and alternate mechanics such as navigating a maze or traversing a series of platforms",['as']
" As Pac Man ignited an even larger video game craze and attracted more female players to arcades, revenues jumped again to $4",['as']
" Meanwhile, the number of arcades—defined as any location with ten or more games—more than doubled between July 1981 and July 1983 from over 10,000 to just over 25,000",['as', 'meanwhile']
" Fairchild semiconductor struck first in this market with the Channel F, but after losing millions in the digital watch business, the company took a conservative approach to the programmable console market and kept production runs of the system low",['first', 'but']
" As a result, by the end of 1977, Fairchild had only sold about 250,000 systems",['as a result', 'as']
" Magnavox joined the programmable market in 1978 with the Odyssey2, while toy company Mattel released the Intellivision in 1979, which featured graphics superior to any of its competitors",['while']
"
After both Atari and Fairchild made a strong showing in 1977, the market hit a difficult patch in 1978 when retailers resisted building inventory, believing that the newly emerging electronic handheld market would displace video games",['that']
" Atari, for example, manufactured 800,000 systems, but proved unable to sell more than 500,000 to retail",['but', 'for example']
" New Atari CEO Ray Kassar subsequently harnessed his company's leftover stock to help transform video game consoles into a year-round product rather than something just purchased by retailers for sale during the holiday season",['rather than']
" Buoyed by the success of the game, Atari's consumer sales almost doubled from $119 million to nearly $204 million in 1980 and then exploded to over $841 million in 1981, while sales across the entire video game industry in the United States rose from $185",['while']
" Mattel settled into second place with roughly 15%-20% of the market, while Magnavox ran a distant third, and Fairchild exited the market entirely in 1979",['while']
" The company went on to develop a string of hits including Kaboom! (1981), River Raid (1982), and Pitfall! (1982), recognized as one of the foundational games of the scrolling platformer genre",['as']

In 1982, Atari released a more advanced console based on its 8-bit computer line, the Atari 5200, which failed to perform as well as its predecessor",['as well']
"
While the fruit of retail development in early video games appeared mainly in video arcades and home consoles, home computers began appearing in the late 1970s and were rapidly evolving in the 1980s, allowing their owners to program simple games",['while']
" Soon many of these games—at first clones of mainframe classics such as Star Trek, and then later ports or clones of popular arcade games such as Space Invaders, Frogger, Pac-Man (see Pac-Man clones) and Donkey Kong—were being distributed through a variety of channels, such as printing the game's source code in books (such as David Ahl's BASIC Computer Games), magazines (Creative Computing), and newsletters, which allowed users to type in the code for themselves",['at first']
"
Games were also distributed by the physical mailing and selling of floppy disks, cassette tapes, and ROM cartridges",['also']
"
The video games industry experienced its first major growing pains in the early 1980s as publishing houses appeared, with many businesses surviving 20+ years, such as Electronic Arts—alongside fly-by-night operations that cheated the games' developers",['as']
" While some early 1980s games were simple clones of existing arcade titles, the relatively low publishing costs for personal computer games allowed for bold, unique games",['while']
"
The Sinclair, Acorn and Amstrad offerings were generally only known in Europe and Africa, the NEC and Sharp offerings were generally only known in Asia, and the MSX had a base in South America, Europe, Middle East and Asia, while the US-based Apple, Commodore and Atari offerings were sold in both the US and Europe",['while']
" By that year the computer gaming market took over from the console market following the crash of that year; computers offered equal gaming ability and, since their simple design allowed games to take complete command of the hardware after power-on, they were nearly as simple to start playing with as consoles",['since']
" It found initial success because it was marketed and priced aggressively",['because']
" It also used the same game controller ports popularized by the Atari 2600, allowing gamers to use their old joysticks with the system",['also']

In 2008 Sid Meier listed the IBM PC as one of the three most important innovations in the history of video games",['as']
" The primitive CGA graphics of prior models, with only 4-color 320×200 pixel graphics (or, using special programming, 16-color 160×100 graphics) had limited the PC's appeal to the business segment, as its graphics failed to compete with the C64 or Apple II",['as']
" However, the sound abilities of the AT were still limited to the PC speaker, which was substandard compared to the built-in sound chips used in many home computers",['still']
" Also, the relatively high cost of the PC compatible systems severely limited their popularity in gaming",['also']

The Apple Macintosh also arrived at this time",['also']
" It lacked the color abilities of the earlier Apple II, instead preferring a much higher pixel resolution, but the operating system support for the graphical user interface (GUI) attracted developers of some games (e",['but', 'instead']
" This was a big jump ahead of most 8-bit home computers but still lagged behind platforms with built-in sound and graphics hardware like the Amiga",['still', 'but']
" Thus while both the ST and Amiga were host to many technically excellent games, their time of prominence was shorter than that of the 8-bit machines, which saw new ports well into the 1980s and even the 1990s",['while']
" This would last until the introduction of Creative Labs' Sound Blaster in 1989, which took the chip and added new features while remaining compatible with Ad Lib cards, and creating a new de facto standard",['while']
" However, many games would still support these and rarer things like the Roland MT-32 and Disney Sound Source into the early 1990s",['still']

Shareware gaming first appeared in the mid-1980s, but its big successes came in the 1990s",['first', 'but']
" Snipes is officially credited as being the original inspiration for NetWare",['as']
" Other services such as Kahn, TEN, Mplayer, and Heat",['as']
" These services ultimately became obsolete when game producers began including their own online software such as Battle",['as']

The first user interfaces were plain-text—similar to BBSs— but they operated on large mainframe computers, permitting larger numbers of users to be online at once",['but']
" Popular text-based services included CompuServe, The Source, and GEnie, while platform-specific graphical services included PlayNET and Quantum Link for the Commodore 64, AppleLink for the Apple II and Macintosh, and PC Link for the IBM PC—all of which were run by the company which eventually became America Online—and a competing service, Prodigy",['while', 'eventually']
" Interactive games were a feature of these services, though until 1987 they used text-based displays, not graphics",['though']
" While the handheld received modest success in the first year of production, the lack of games, screen size and video game crash of 1983 brought about the system's quick demise",['while']
" Improving LCD technology meant the new handhelds could be more reliable and consume fewer batteries than LED or VFD games, most only needing watch batteries",['most + [a-z]*ly']
" They could also be made much smaller than most LED handhelds, even small enough to wear on one's wrist like a watch",['also']
" Tiger Electronics borrowed this concept of videogaming with cheap, affordable handhelds and still produces games in this model to the present day",['still']
"
At the end of 1983, several factors, including a market flooded with poor-quality games, the commercial failure of several important Atari 2600 titles, and home computers emerging as a new and more advanced gaming platform, caused the industry to experience a severe downturn",['as']
"
As a result of the crash, a globally important video gaming industry emerged in Japan, creating important room for companies like Nintendo and Sega",['as a result', 'as']
"
Whilst a broken gaming industry in the US took several local businesses to bankruptcy and practically ended retail interest in video gaming products, an 8-bit third generation of video game consoles started in Japan as early as 1983 with the release of both Nintendo's Family Computer ("Famicom") and Sega's SG-1000 on July 15",['as']
" The first clearly trumped the second in terms of commercial success in the country, causing Sega to replace it, two years later, by a severely improved and modernized version called the Sega Mark III",['clearly']
"[citation needed]
In efforts to make the Famicom marketable in the US, Nintendo created a completely redesigned version of it, called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), to be sold in the country as a product unrelated to video gaming",['as']
" For this same reason, the company also developed a toy robot accessory called the R",['also']
" The console was later released in other Western countries, but because of heavy competition from home computers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64, and a lack of marketing, the NES was prevented from having as much success in Europe",['because', 'but']
" While Sega focused on unique gameplay experiences and innovative technology (with Master System's superior technical properties which allowed better graphics, and accessories like LCD glasses), Nintendo focused on creating long and popular game franchises which often repeated the same features",['while']
"91 million worldwide copies, against 14",['against']

In this generation, the gamepad or joypad, took over for joysticks, paddles, and keypads as the default game controller",['as']
" This generation also marked a shift in the dominance of home video game console hardware and console game production from the United States to Japan",['also']
"
The third console generation marked the debut of various high-profile role-playing franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Phantasy Star and Final Fantasy, the latter of which financially saved Japanese developer Square",['as']

By 1989 the market for cartridge-based console games was more than $2 billion, while that for disk-based computer games was less than $300 million",['while', 'that']
" Large computer-game companies such as Epyx, Electronic Arts, and LucasArts began devoting much or all of their attention on console games",['as']
" Even though it was technically superior to the Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System, it was discontinued after 6 months",['even though', 'though']
" The TurboGrafx-16, named the PC Engine in Europe and Japan, debuted in 1987 as the first commercial 16-bit game system",['as']
" It had a large following in Japan, but, did poorly in North America and Europe because of its limited library of games and because of excessive distribution restrictions imposed by Hudson Soft",['because', 'but']
" The TurboGrafx-16 was billed as the first 16-bit system but its central processor was an 8-bit HuC6280, with only its HuC6270 graphics processor being a true 16-bit chip",['but']
" Also, the much earlier Mattel Intellivision contained a 16-bit processor",['also']
"
In Japan, the PC Engine was a very successful competitor against the Famicom and a CD drive peripheral allowed it to fend off the Mega Drive in 1988, though it never really caught on to the same degree outside Japan",['against', 'though']
" The PC Engine eventually lost out to the Super Famicom, but, due to its popular CD add-ons, retained enough of a user base to support new games well into the late 1990s",['but', 'eventually']

CD-ROM drives were introduced in this generation, as add-ons for the PC Engine in 1988 and the Mega Drive in 1991",['as']
" Nintendo experimented with optical media formats for the SNES in a joint venture with Sony, who would go on to develop this concept into the PlayStation and rise to prominence as a major competitor to Nintendo and Sega",['as']
" Basic 3D graphics entered the mainstream with flat-shaded polygons enabled by added processors in game cartridges like Virtua Racing and Star Fox, while the Mega Drive managed to produce such graphics without special processors, on the ≈8 MHz 68000 chip by using highly simplified polygon models, a slow frame rate (<4 fps), and reduced resolution",['while']
" The reason for this was that it contained the same hardware that was found in SNK's arcade games",['that']
" This was the first time since the home Pong machines that a true-to-the-arcade experience could be had at home, but the system was commercially inviable",['that', 'but']
"
This era also saw a revival of handheld consoles, which were absent in the prior generation",['also']
" The other consoles also had scarce game libraries compared to over one thousand games released for the Game Boy, including best-selling titles Pokémon Red and Blue, and which inspired an entire line of portable machines that continued through the following two generations",['also']
" Arcade games experienced a resurgence in the early-to-mid-1990s, followed by a decline in the late 1990s as home consoles became more common",['as']
"
As arcade games declined, however, the home video game industry matured into a more mainstream form of entertainment in the 1990s, but their video games also became more and more controversial because of their violent nature, especially in games of Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, and Doom, leading to the formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and their rating games by signing them their ESRB ratings since 1994",['also', 'because', 'as', 'but']
" Examples of this include Mark Hamill's involvement with Wing Commander III, the introduction of QSound with arcade system boards such as Capcom's CP System II, and the high production budgets of titles such as Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII and Sega's Shenmue",['as']
" Its success led to a wave of other popular fighting games, such as Mortal Kombat and The King of Fighters",['as']
" Sports games such as NBA Jam also briefly became popular in arcades during this period",['also', 'as']

However, with the advent of 32- and 64-bit consoles in the mid-1990s, home video game consoles such as the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 also became able to produce texture-mapped 3D graphics",['also', 'as']
" Increasing numbers of players would wait for popular arcade games to be ported to consoles rather than pumping coins into arcade kiosks",['rather than']
"[citation needed] To remain relevant, arcade manufacturers such as Sega and Namco continued pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics beyond what was possible in homes",['as']
" Virtua Fighter 3 for the Sega Model 3, for instance, stood out for having real-time 3D graphics approaching the quality of CGI full motion video (FMV) at the time",['for instance']
" After producing the more powerful Hikaru board in 1999 and Naomi 2 in 2000, Sega eventually stopped manufacturing custom arcade system boards, with their subsequent arcade boards being based on either consoles or commercial PC components",['either', 'eventually', '(E|e)(ither).+?(or)']

As patronage of arcades declined, many were forced to close down",['as']
" The design team headed by Gunpei Yokoi had also been responsible for the Game & Watch systems",['also']
" Although these systems were more technologically advanced, they were hampered by higher battery consumption and less third-party developer support",['more + [a-z]*ly', 'although']
" While some of the other systems remained in production until the mid-1990s, the Game Boy, and its successive incarnations the Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, would be virtually unchallenged for dominance in the handheld market, until the PlayStation Portable was released in 2004 to compete with Nintendo's successor to the Game Boy line, the Nintendo DS",['while']
" Since the shareware versions were essentially free, the cost only needed to cover the disk and minimal packaging",['since', 'essentially']
" As the increasing size of games in the mid-1990s made them impractical to fit on floppies, and retail publishers and developers began to earnestly mimic the practice, shareware games were replaced by shorter game demos (often only one or two levels), distributed free on CDs with gaming magazines and over the Internet",['as']
" Meanwhile, Alone in the Dark influenced the survival-horror genre with its action-adventure elements",['meanwhile']
" These devoted 3D rendering daughterboards performed a portion of the computations and memory-handling required for more-detailed three-dimensional graphics (mainly texture filtering), allowing for more-detailed graphics than would be possible if the CPU were required to handle both game logic and all the graphical tasks",['if']
" While other games would also make use of it, the FPS would become the main driving force behind the development of new 3D hardware, and the yardstick by which its performance would be measured, usually quantified as the number of frames per second rendered for a given scene in a given game",['while', 'also']
" Other genres also began to offer online play in the late 90s, including real-time strategy games as Age of Empires, the Warcraft and StarCraft series, and turn-based games such as Heroes of Might and Magic",['also', 'as']
" Also in 1993, The 3DO Company released the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, which, though highly advertised and promoted, failed to catch up to the sales of the Jaguar, due to its high pricetag",['also', 'though']

The Virtual Boy from Nintendo was released in 1995 as one of the first consumer consoles providing 3D depth perception, but did not achieve high sales, largely due to the monochrome display and the lack of third-party support",['but']

Nintendo's choice to continue using ROM cartridges instead of moving to CD-ROMs for the Nintendo 64, unique among the consoles of this period, proved to have negative consequences for the console and for Nintendo's market share",['instead']
" While cartridges had faster access times, were more durable and resistant to unlicensed copying, CDs could hold far more data (650MB, over ten times the capacity of the largest N64 ROM at 64MB) and cost far less to produce, causing many game companies to turn to Nintendo's CD-based competitors",['while']
" Notably, Square, which had released all prior games in its Final Fantasy series for Nintendo consoles, now turned exclusively to the PlayStation; Final Fantasy VII (1997) was a massive success, establishing the popularity of role-playing video games in the west and making the PlayStation the primary console for the genre, taking the crown from Nintendo who had enjoyed it with the SNES and Square's then Nintendo-exclusive Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger titles",['notably']

"Although, voters under Athenian democracy were allowed the same opportunity to voice their opinion and to sway the discussion, they were not always successful, and, often, the minority was forced to vote in favor of a motion that they did not agree with",['although']
" While there seems to have also been a type of citizen assembly (presumably of the hoplite class), the archons and the body of the Areopagus ran the state and the mass of people had no say in government at all before these reforms",['while', 'also', 'presumably']
"Solon's reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied classes and not only from the aristocratic families",['not only']

" The Areopagus kept its power as 'Guardian of the Laws', which meant that it could veto actions it deemed unconstitutional, however this worked in practice",['that', 'as']
" In the play The Eumenides, performed in 458, Aeschylus, himself a noble, portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena herself, an apparent attempt to preserve the dignity of the Areopagus in the face of its disempowerment",['as']
" For example, a citizen could only be a member of the Boule in two non-consecutive years in their life",['for example']
" Age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum, rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time",['as']
" An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement (atimia), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type)",['also']
" Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (dokimasia) at which time they might be disqualified",['furthermore']
"While citizens voting in the assembly were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office served the people and could be punished very severely",['while']
" In addition to being subject to review prior to holding office, officeholders were also subject to an examination after leaving office (euthunai, 'straightenings' or 'submission of accounts') to review their performance",['also']
" Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up the possibility of a contest before a jury court if some citizen wanted to take a matter up",['if', 'but']

" Competence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies",['but']
" In the 5th century setup, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers",['but', 'rather than']
"The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship, rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought",['rather than']
" Allotment therefore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens political equality, as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office",['therefore']
" This also acted as a check against demagoguery, though this check was imperfect and did not prevent elections from involving pandering to voters",['against', 'also', 'as', 'though']
"The random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to mitigate possible problems",['but']
" Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels)",['as']

" In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime",['in this case', 'simply']
" This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons",['as']
" To the Athenians, it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing power",['against', 'but']
"During an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot",['rather than']
" One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money embezzled could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite",['that', 'but', 'in this case']
"Generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge, but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought",['also', 'because', 'but', 'not only']
" In the 5th century BC, principally as seen through the figure of Pericles, the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis",['as']

" Ancient Greek critics of Athenian democracy include Thucydides the general and historian, Aristophanes the playwright, Plato the pupil of Socrates, Aristotle the pupil of Plato, and a writer known as the Old Oligarch",['as']
" While modern critics are more likely to find fault with the restrictive qualifications for political involvement, these ancients viewed democracy as being too inclusive",['while', 'as']
" According to Samons:
The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or theoretical level)",['but']
" And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures, mistakes, and misdeeds—most infamously, the execution of Socrates—that would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good government",['most + [a-z]*ly', 'what is more']
"Thucydides, from his aristocratic and historical viewpoint, reasoned that a serious flaw in democratic government was that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly, in contrast to his own critical-historical approach to history",['that']

While Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates, his criticisms of the rule of the demos were much more extensive",['while']

" If the Assembly voted in favor of the proposed change, the proposal would be referred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai (literally "establishers of the law")",['if', 'further']
" That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day)",['that is', 'though']

" The early history of video games, therefore, covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s (Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey, both in 1972)",['therefore']

Following the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s",['as', 'as well']
" Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research",['also', 'as']
" Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope",['simply']
" As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s",['as']
" As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed",['as']
" This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems",['rather than']
" Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games",['as', 'though', 'rather than']

The ancestors to these games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen",['as', 'as well']
" While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes",['while']
" Around the same time as the device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time",['actually', 'as', 'though']

Around this time, non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories; for example, Christopher Strachey developed a simulation of the game draughts, or checkers, for the Pilot ACE that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British National Physical Laboratory and completed in 1952; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general-purpose computer, rather than a machine specifically made for the game like Bertie",['that', 'for example', 'rather than']
" Also in 1951, Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the University of Manchester's general-purpose Ferranti Mark 1 computer, one of the first commercially available computers",['also']

" As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game",['as']

The first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time, rather than only when the player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954",['rather than']
" The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion",['so', 'as']

While further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers, the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with Tennis for Two",['while', 'further']

Over the next few years, during 1957–61, various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches",['as', 'rather than']
" A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer",['while', 'also']
" The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze",['against']
" Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The Management Game, which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958",['also', 'as']
" As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, there was no such thing as a commercial video game industry; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment",['as', '(N|n)(either).+?(nor)']

The two-player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield",['against']
" The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game",['therefore']
" The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship",['because']
" As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad",['as', 'essentially']
" Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware",['since']
" Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience",['still', 'although']

" Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing",['while', 'still', 'but']
" Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price",['though']
" They had found the Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project",['actually']
" While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100",['while', 'that', 'as', 'rather than']

" Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!",['actually']
" Galaxy Game's prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan",['eventually', 'though']
"
Around the same time as Galaxy Game's prototype installation, Computer Space was released",['as']
" While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where pinball and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who had expected to sell more than 1,500 units",['while']
" Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as Computer Space, as well as founding their own company Atari, Inc",['as', 'as well']
" While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, Allan Alcorn, took a prototype ping-pong game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on",['while']
" They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves",['but']
