"Now before we get a further to clarify exactly what we're talking about we're talking about banning video games in which realistic violence is central to the gameplay or that feature explicit photo, realistic cut scenes that display graphic violence and explain our position on this issue, we're going to talk about two different issues",True,
"First, the fact that video games are uniquely effective teaching tools, adam and second, the fact that by its very nature, the regulation system under the status quo is ineffective at preventing children from accessing these video games and therefore that a band is the only reasonable way to expect to achieve any sort of concrete results",True,

" Ultimately, the widespread adoption of computers to play games would have to wait for the machines to spread from serious academics to their students on US college campuses",False
The mainframe computers of the 1950s were generally batch processing machines of limited speed and memory,False
 This made them generally unsuited for games,False
" At the Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), however, a team led by Jay Forrester developed a computer called Whirlwind in the early 1950s that processed commands in real time and incorporated a faster and more reliable form of random access memory (RAM) based around magnetic cores",False
" Based on this work, two employees at the lab named Ken Olsen and Wes Clark developed a prototype real time computer called the TX-0 that incorporated the recently invented transistor, which ultimately allowed the size and cost of computers to be significantly reduced",False

"By 1970, the introduction of medium scale integration (MSI) transistor–transistor logic (TTL) circuits combining multiple transistors on a single microchip had resulted in another significant reduction in the cost of computing and ushered in a new wave of minicomputers costing under $10,000",False

" Working primarily with technician Bill Harrison, who built most of the actual hardware, Baer developed a series of prototype systems between 1966 and 1969 based around diode–transistor logic (DTL) circuits that would send a video signal to a television set to generate spots on the screen that could be controlled by the players",False
" Originally able to generate only two spots, the system was modified in November 1967 at the suggestion of engineer Bill Rusch to generate a third spot for use in a table tennis game in which each player controlled a single spot that served as a paddle and volleyed the third spot, which acted as a ball",False
" In 1971, Sanders concluded a licensing agreement with television company Magnavox to release the system, which reached the market in September 1972 as the Magnavox Odyssey",False
" The system launched with a dozen games included in the box, four more sold with a separate light gun, and six games sold separately, most of which were chase, racing, target shooting, or sports games",False

" Other entrepreneur's imitated Millman's format, and arcades became a mainstay of the shopping mall by the end of the decade",False
"The Magnavox Odyssey never caught on with the public, due largely to the limited functionality of its primitive technology",False
" By the middle of the 1970s, however, the ball-and-paddle craze in the arcade had ignited public interest in video games and continuing advances in integrated circuits had resulted in large-scale integration (LSI) microchips cheap enough to be incorporated into a consumer product",False

"Secondly, on the reward system, the way video games work is that they compel you to commit violence acts based on a reward system that means that if you commit a violent act, you get a prize, you get points, you get levels in the game, you get advancements in the story telling the story line of the game",True,
