We introduce the complementary task of Claim Stance Classification, along with the first benchmark dataset for this task. We decompose this problem into: (a) open-domain target identification for topic and claim (b) sentiment classification for each target, and (c) open-domain contrast detection between the topic and the claim targets. Manual annotation of the dataset confirms the applicability and validity of our model. We describe an implementation of our model, focusing on a novel algorithm for contrast detection. Our approach achieves promising results, and is shown to outperform several baselines, which represent the common practice of applying a single, monolithic classifier for stance classification.},

However, argumentative sentences are often characterized by common rhetorical structures, independently of the domain.

Opinion mining further extended the scope of the search to help companies, such as those specialising in media analysis, to automate extraction of people's beliefs about products, insti-tutions, politicians, celebrities. Now, argument mining goes one more step ahead to provide us with instant information not only about what attitudes and opinions people hold, but also about arguments which people give in favour (pro) and against (con) these attitudes and opinions. When this rapidly developing technology will mature, it will allow us to automatically and empirically explore vast amount of social media data (rather than seeking advices and opinions of experts) to give us answers such as why people decided to vote for one presidential candidate rather than the other.},

Second, we classify a pair of argument components as either support or non-support for identifying the structure of argumentative discourse. For both tasks, we evaluate several classifiers and propose novel feature sets including structural, lexical, syntactic and contextual features.

These applications are widely adopted with the consequence that the number of opinions about the debated issues increases. In order to cut in on a debate, the participants need first to evaluate the opinions in favour or against the debated issue. Argumentation theory proposes algorithms and semantics to evalu- ate the set of accepted arguments, given the conflicts among them. The main problem is how to automatically generate the arguments from the natural language formulation of the opinions used in these applications. Our paper addresses this problem by proposing and evaluating the use of natural language techniques to generate the ar- guments. In particular, we adopt the textual entailment approach, a generic framework for applied semantics, where linguistic objects are mapped by means of semantic inferences at a textual level. We couple textual entailment together with a Dung-like argumentation system which allows us to identify the arguments that are accepted in the considered online debate. The originality of the proposed frame- work lies in the following point: natural language debates are ana- lyzed and the arguments are automatically extracted.},

	abstract = {While discussing a concrete controversial topic, most humans will find it challenging to swiftly raise a diverse set of convincing and relevant claims that should set the basis of their arguments. Here, we formally define the challenging task of automatic claim detection in a given context and discuss its associated unique difficulties. Further, we outline a preliminary solution to this task, and assess its performance over annotated real world data, collected specifically for that purpose over hundreds of Wikipedia articles. We report promising results of a supervised learning approach, which is based on a cascade of classifiers designed to properly handle the skewed data which is inherent to the defined task. These results demonstrate the viability of the introduced task},

@article{Rinott2015,
	abstract = {Engaging in a debate with oneself or others to take decisions is an integral part of our day-today life. A debate on a topic (say, use of performance enhancing drugs) typically proceeds by one party making an assertion/claim (say, PEDs are bad for health) and then providing an evidence to support the claim (say, a 2006 study shows that PEDs have psychiatric side effects). In this work, we propose the task of automatically detecting such evidences from unstructured text that support a given claim. This task has many practical applications in decision support and persuasion enhancement in a wide range of domains. We first introduce an extensive benchmark data set tailored for this task, which allows training statistical models and assessing their performance. Then, we suggest a system architecture based on supervised learning to address the evidence detection task. Finally, promising experimental results are reported},
